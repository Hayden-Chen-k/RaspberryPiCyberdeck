Resources for my Raspberry Pi Cyberdeck

I'll be posting and updating this page with the resources I've used to create my Raspberry Pi Cyberdeck!

You might want to buy a Raspberry Pi or another SBC before starting this project. I just used a Pi because I had one lying around but there are more powerful alternatives like the latte panda mu, though those may need you to design a carrier board if the existing ones don't fit your needs.

Have fun with your engineering ventures!
